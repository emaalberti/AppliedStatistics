# AppliedStatistics

Repository for Applied Statistics assignments throughout the course.

---ASSIGNMENT---
The assignments were mini projects to face in groups of 3/4 students, and to submit on the professor's repository. They have pretty much the same topics of the labs.

---LABS---
I have just added all the labs and the list of their topics, here's a quick recap:

Lab 2 - Theory of PCA
Lab 3 - Hierarchical Clustering + Evaluation Metrics
Lab 4 - K-Means & GMM Clustering + Evaluation
Lab 5 - LDA & QDA + KNN
Lab 6 - Linear Regression
Lab 7 - Logistics Regression - Binary and Multiclass
Lab 8 - Variable Selection, Cross Validation and Regularization
Lab 9 - Trees, Random Forest and Boosting

Every laboratories were paired with at least two theoretical lectures (pretty though lol) to learn the theoretical math behind methods.

---EXAM----
Exam consinsted of a first theoretical part and 2 coding exercises where we got asked to implement labs methods.
