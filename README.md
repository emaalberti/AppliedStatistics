# AppliedStatistics

Repository for Applied Statistics assignments throughout the course.

---

## ASSIGNMENTS
The assignments were mini projects to face in groups of 3/4 students, and to submit on the professor's repository.  
They have pretty much the same topics of the labs.

## LABS
I have just added all the labs and the list of their topics, here's a quick recap:

- **Lab 2** – Theory of PCA  
- **Lab 3** – Hierarchical Clustering + Evaluation Metrics  
- **Lab 4** – K-Means & GMM Clustering + Evaluation  
- **Lab 5** – LDA & QDA + KNN  
- **Lab 6** – Linear Regression  
- **Lab 7** – Logistic Regression (Binary and Multiclass)  
- **Lab 8** – Variable Selection, Cross Validation and Regularization  
- **Lab 9** – Trees, Random Forest and Boosting  

Every laboratory was paired with at least two theoretical lectures (pretty tough lol) to learn the theoretical math behind the methods.

## EXAM
The exam consisted of:  
- A first **theoretical part**  
- **2 coding exercises** where we were asked to implement the methods studied in the labs.
